- Handling missing data.
- Data normalization and standardization.
- Encoding categorical data.

3. Classification Algorithms
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Implementation and usage for classification tasks.
- Naive Bayes: Theory and implementation of Naive Bayes.
- Decision Tree: Building and visualizing Decision Trees.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM): Concepts and implementation of SVM.

4. Classification Algorithm Evaluation
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
- Confusion Matrix.
- Cross-validation techniques.

5. Clustering
- K-Means Clustering: Theory and implementation of K-Means.
